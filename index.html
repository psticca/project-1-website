            <p>Hello, my name is Peter Sticca. Also known as ‘SpeCla‘. I am a Computer Science student at Murdoch University, computer enthusiast and avid gamer who is very competitive.</p>

            <p>Currently, my main game is Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, but over the last couple years, I have also achieved well above average rankings in Overwatch, Battlefield 1, World of Warcraft and League of Legends.</p>

            <p>I’m an all round gamer who enjoys all types of games, but the FPS genre appeals to me the most as it is usually very competitive.</p>

            <p>I am currently employed at Secure Computer Recycling and Disposal (SCRD) and have been in the company for 6 years. I learnt to build desktop computers from a young age and over the years have honed my skills. I can safely claim to have built over 100 computers for friends and family, within all price ranges. Basically I have become my friends and families – IT guy. Soon to come, a full custom water-loop in my desktop computer.</p>
